When contributing, please follow the template given in the issues.

You should give us the following information:

* Anime name
* Anidb link (Optional, preferable)
* Filtering applied
* Screenshots if possible
* Source types (BD, Web, etc.)

We do not accept every single show to be added to the list,
but if it's close enough to be considered "QTEC-tier filtering",
it will be considered.
