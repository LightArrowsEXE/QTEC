# QTEC'd anime blu-rays

This is a comprehensive list of all the anime blu-ray (BD) releases that have been severely mangled by QTEC.

If you know any QTEC'd shows that are missing from this list, please contact me @LightArrowsEXE.

## About

QTEC is a BD authoring company widely-known throughout the anime encoding community
for their heavy and poor filtering of SD shows.
As a result, shows that received their filtering
(or similar filtering from other companies)
became colloquially known as being "QTEC'd".

This list exists to document such cases,
so while not every show will be a QTEC release,
they will have received similar filtering
and are just as unpreferable as QTEC's awful BDs.

Their lineart is often mangled, temporally unstable,
and has a weird watercolour-like effect.
Haloing is common.
Textures may have been denoised away,
or turned into a slushie.
Colours are often negatively affected.
They are typically also poorly deinterlaced and scaled,
leading to issues when dealing with subbing
or filtering that requires an accurate PAR.

If you have an interest in encoding these shows,
please double-check all available sources you can get your hands on.
Do note that it's not uncommon for DVDs that came out later to be downscales of the QTEC masters!

What this list **is not**:

* A list of all bad BDs.
  * Plenty bad BDs exist.
    This list is exclusively for shows that were QTEC'd,
    or received filtering on par with a QTEC SD upscale.
* A recommendation for what release to grab.
  * If you want to know what the best encode is for any given show,
   consult the [SeaDex](https://sneedex.moe/).
