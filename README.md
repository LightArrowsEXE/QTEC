# Catalogue of poor anime mastering and authoring

**Note: This project is still WIP!**

This repo serves as a catalogue of the many anime blu-rays (BDs)
that were mangled by their respective authoring company,
studio, or other persons.
This kind of filtering is often labelled as being "QTEC'd",
in reference to the BD authoring company, QTEC.

If you know any poorly-authored shows that are missing from this catalogue,
please contact me @LightArrowsEXE.

## What is this for?

There are many BDs out there that were mastered extremely poorly,
to the point of DVDs vastly outperforming them in the quality department.

Having a repo like this handy allows people to see what shows could use improved encodes.
Our hope is that this will spur on some of the more skilled encoders
to go make their own filtered encodes of either the BDs or a better source
so viewers won't have to suffer through the poorly-authored video.
